<summary>Philip Taranto <br> Title: Characterising & Controlling Complex Quantum Processes with Classical Memory </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Most prominently, memory can be controlled to reliably prepare states, simulate non-Markovian phenomena, enhance information processing, and control circuit architectures; such primitives are routinely used in classical computers to improve performance. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they appear ubiquitously across natural and engineered processes and can be either classical or quantum. While quantum correlations in time constitute a promising resource for future technologies, control over quantum memory might be out of reach (beyond laboratory settings) in the near future since it requires delicate experimental setups. From a practical standpoint, manipulating quantum processes with classical memory seems more manageable and promises more near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterparts, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored, and consequently so too does the usefulness of classical memory in quantum processes.<br> <br> 

We first analyse various physically motivated candidates regarding a suitable definition for classical memory that lead to remarkably distinct phenomena. In the simplest scenario—the two-time setting—quantum processes with classical memory coincide with convex mixtures of memoryless processes and are thus straightforward to analyse. However, as we demonstrate, this is no longer true in the multi-time setting: here, (classical) memory effects display a more intricate structure. Subsequently, we systematically characterise the hierarchy of multi-time memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena. Our analysis highlights that the multi-time scenario permits fundamentally different temporal correlations, even when only classical memory is considered. Since noise in quantum devices—and thus the observed memory effects—will predominantly be classical in the near future, our results provide a framework upon which reliable quantum devices can be built. The concepts explored, and results presented here should have immediate impact on various fields of quantum science, including quantum information theory, optimal control, open quantum systems, and quantum foundations, to name but a few. <br><br>
