<summary> <b>Ion Nechita</b> <br> Title: Monogamy of highly symmetric states </summary>
<br>
Abstract: We study the question of how highly entangled two particles can be when also entangled in a similar way with other particles on the complete graph Kn for the case of Werner, isotropic and Brauer states. We formalize our question as a semidefinite program and then solve this optimization problem analytically, using tools from representation theory. In particular, we determine the exact maximum values p of the projection to the maximally entangled state and antisymmetric Werner state possible, solving long-standing open problems. This is joint work with Rene Allerstorfer, Matthias Christandl, Dmitry Grinko, Maris Ozols, Denis Rochette, and Philip Verduyn Lunel.<br><br>

<summary><b> Tatsuki Odake</b>  <br>Title: Higher-order quantum transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics </summary>
<br>
Abstract: 
We present a quantum algorithm to achieve higher-order transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics. Namely, the algorithm takes as input a finite number of queries to a black-box seed Hamiltonian dynamics to simulate a desired Hamiltonian. Our algorithm efficiently simulates linear transformations of any seed Hamiltonian with a bounded energy range consisting of a polynomial number of terms in system size, making use of only controlled-Pauli gates and time-correlated randomness. This algorithm is an instance of quantum functional programming, where the desired function is specified as a concatenation of higher-order quantum transformations. By way of example, we demonstrate the simulation of negative time-evolution and perform a Hamiltonian learning task.<br><br>

<summary> <b>Ivan Šupić</b> <br> Title: Quantum networks aid certification of quantum resources </summary>
<br>
Abstract: In this talk I will explain how quantum network architecture together with self-testing techniques can aid certification of various quantum resources. In particular, I will discuss device-independent protocols for universal entanglement certification, a self-testing result that can be applied to all pure entangled quantum states, and network-device-independent certification of causal nonseparability.

<summary> <b>Vorapong Suppakitpaisarn</b> <br> Title: Utilizing Graph Sparsification for Pre-processing in Maxcut QUBO Solver </summary>
<br>
Abstract: We suggest employing graph sparsification as a pre-processing step for maxcut programs using the QUBO solver. Quantum(-inspired) algorithms are recognized for their potential efficiency in handling quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Given that maxcut is an NP-hard problem and can be readily expressed using QUBO, it stands out as an exemplary case to demonstrate the effectiveness of quantum(-inspired) QUBO approaches. Here, the non-zero count in the QUBO matrix corresponds to the graph's edge count. Given that many quantum(-inspired) solvers operate through cloud services, transmitting data for dense graphs can be costly. By introducing the graph sparsification method, we aim to mitigate these communication costs. Experimental results on classical, quantum-inspired, and quantum solvers indicate that this approach substantially reduces communication overheads and yields an objective value close to the optimal solution.

<summary> <b> Philip Taranto</b>  <br> Title: Characterising & Controlling Complex Quantum Processes with Classical Memory </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Most prominently, memory can be controlled to reliably prepare states, simulate non-Markovian phenomena, enhance information processing, and control circuit architectures; such primitives are routinely used in classical computers to improve performance. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they appear ubiquitously across natural and engineered processes and can be either classical or quantum. While quantum correlations in time constitute a promising resource for future technologies, control over quantum memory might be out of reach (beyond laboratory settings) in the near future since it requires delicate experimental setups. From a practical standpoint, manipulating quantum processes with classical memory seems more manageable and promises more near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterparts, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored, and consequently so too does the usefulness of classical memory in quantum processes.<br> <br> 

We first analyse various physically motivated candidates regarding a suitable definition for classical memory that lead to remarkably distinct phenomena. In the simplest scenario—the two-time setting—quantum processes with classical memory coincide with convex mixtures of memoryless processes and are thus straightforward to analyse. However, as we demonstrate, this is no longer true in the multi-time setting: here, (classical) memory effects display a more intricate structure. Subsequently, we systematically characterise the hierarchy of multi-time memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena. Our analysis highlights that the multi-time scenario permits fundamentally different temporal correlations, even when only classical memory is considered. Since noise in quantum devices—and thus the observed memory effects—will predominantly be classical in the near future, our results provide a framework upon which reliable quantum devices can be built. The concepts explored, and results presented here should have immediate impact on various fields of quantum science, including quantum information theory, optimal control, open quantum systems, and quantum foundations, to name but a few. <br><br>
