<summary><b> Alastair Abbott</b>  <br>Title: Improving social welfare in non-cooperative games with different types of quantum resources</summary>
<br>
Abstract: We investigate what quantum advantages can be obtained in multipartite non-cooperative games by studying how different types of quantum resources can lead to new Nash equilibria and improve social welfare -- a measure of the quality of an equilibrium. Two different quantum settings are analysed: a first, in which players are given direct access to an entangled quantum state, and a second, which we introduce here, in which they are only given classical advice obtained from quantum devices. For a given game G, these two settings give rise to different equilibria characterised by the sets of equilibrium correlations Qcorr(G) and Q(G), respectively. We show that Q(G)⊆Qcorr(G), and by exploiting the self-testing property of some correlations, that the inclusion is strict for some games G. We make use of SDP optimisation techniques to study how these quantum resources can improve social welfare, obtaining upper and lower bounds on the social welfare reachable in each setting. We investigate, for several games, how the social welfare depends on the bias of the game and improve upon a separation that was previously obtained using pseudo-telepathic solutions.<br><br>

<summary><b> Paolo Fittipaldi</b>  <br>Title: A Linear Algebraic Framework for Dynamic Scheduling Over Memory-Equipped Quantum Networks </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Quantum Internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between arbitrary pairs of users. In this context, a scheduling policy (i.e. a set of rules that, given some amount of information about the network’s state, provides the correct set of entanglement swapping operations to perform in order to satisfy user requests) is of paramount importance to simultaneously serve multiple pairs of users over complex network topologies.
In this talk, the problem of scheduling in an arbitrary quantum network is presented in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware formulation. We introduce a novel linear algebraic framework that leverages quantum memory and demonstrate how it can be employed to derive a natural class of quadratic scheduling policies for quantum networks. We then illustrate how the framework aids in describing and benchmarking several scheduling policies, with different degrees of localization and information availability. Network performance results such as the average and total user demand are discussed to evaluate the capacity regions of the proposed policies, and to provide example of application of our tools to arbitrary scheduling policies over general quantum networks with topologies of various complexity.

<summary><b> Uta Isabella Meyer</b>  <br>Title: Non-locality from Wigner Negativity in Qudit Stabilizer States </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Contextuality and non-locality serve as crucial tools for
distinguishing quantum from classical systems and have been extensively
studied for qubits.
While some attention has been given to extending these concepts to
higher-dimensional systems, studying them in this context appears to be
more challenging than their two-level counterparts.
In particular, violating Bell inequalities based on Clifford operations
with stabilizer states in qudit systems is futile as they are
efficiently simulatable.
Beyond Clifford operations, Bell inequalities have been proposed whose
classical bound or the extent of quantum violation have been difficult
to quantify.
Furthermore, they resort to operations intrinsic to higher or lower
dimensional systems than those of interest.
We propose a family of Bell inequalities based on a generalization of
the qubit $\pi/8$ gate and the Wigner negativity of
stabilizer states under their adjoint action.
These operators are fully characterized within the finite field of their
prime dimension.
The classical bound is simple to compute and a specified stabilizer
state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states.
We exemplify these Bell inequalities on qudit graph states and formalize
a mapping that implements local complementation of the underlying
weighted graphs.
Lastly, we present a simple family of Bell inequalities violated by the
singlet state relying on operations innate to higher dimensional systems
than the examined one.

<summary> <b>Ion Nechita</b> <br> Title: Monogamy of highly symmetric states </summary>
<br>
Abstract: We study the question of how highly entangled two particles can be when also entangled in a similar way with other particles on the complete graph Kn for the case of Werner, isotropic and Brauer states. We formalize our question as a semidefinite program and then solve this optimization problem analytically, using tools from representation theory. In particular, we determine the exact maximum values p of the projection to the maximally entangled state and antisymmetric Werner state possible, solving long-standing open problems. This is joint work with Rene Allerstorfer, Matthias Christandl, Dmitry Grinko, Maris Ozols, Denis Rochette, and Philip Verduyn Lunel.<br><br>

<summary><b> Tatsuki Odake</b>  <br>Title: Higher-order quantum transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics </summary>
<br>
Abstract: 
We present a quantum algorithm to achieve higher-order transformations of Hamiltonian dynamics. Namely, the algorithm takes as input a finite number of queries to a black-box seed Hamiltonian dynamics to simulate a desired Hamiltonian. Our algorithm efficiently simulates linear transformations of any seed Hamiltonian with a bounded energy range consisting of a polynomial number of terms in system size, making use of only controlled-Pauli gates and time-correlated randomness. This algorithm is an instance of quantum functional programming, where the desired function is specified as a concatenation of higher-order quantum transformations. By way of example, we demonstrate the simulation of negative time-evolution and perform a Hamiltonian learning task.<br><br>

<summary><b> Pierre Pocreau</b>  <br>Title: Quantum Query Complexity of Boolean Functions under Indefinite Causal Order </summary>
<br>
Abstract: The standard model of quantum circuits assumes operations are applied in a fixed sequential
“causal” order. In recent years, the possibility of relaxing this constraint to obtain causally in-
definite computations has received significant attention. The quantum switch, for example, uses
a quantum system to coherently control the order of operations. Several ad hoc computational
and information-theoretical advantages have been demonstrated, raising questions as to whether
advantages can be obtained in a more unified complexity theoretic framework. In this paper, we
approach this problem by studying the query complexity of Boolean functions under general higher
order quantum computations. To this end, we generalise the framework of query complexity from
quantum circuits to quantum supermaps to compare different models on an equal footing. We show
that the recently introduced class of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order cannot
lead to any reduction in query complexity, and that any potential advantage arising from causally
indefinite supermaps can be bounded by the polynomial method, as is the case with quantum cir-
cuits. Nevertheless, we find some functions for which the minimum error with which they can be
computed using two queries is strictly lower when exploiting causally indefinite supermaps.

<br>
Abstract: In this talk I will explain how quantum network architecture together with self-testing techniques can aid certification of various quantum resources. In particular, I will discuss device-independent protocols for universal entanglement certification, a self-testing result that can be applied to all pure entangled quantum states, and network-device-independent certification of causal nonseparability.

<summary> <b>Vorapong Suppakitpaisarn</b> <br> Title: Utilizing Graph Sparsification for Pre-processing in Maxcut QUBO Solver </summary>
<br>
Abstract: We suggest employing graph sparsification as a pre-processing step for maxcut programs using the QUBO solver. Quantum(-inspired) algorithms are recognized for their potential efficiency in handling quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Given that maxcut is an NP-hard problem and can be readily expressed using QUBO, it stands out as an exemplary case to demonstrate the effectiveness of quantum(-inspired) QUBO approaches. Here, the non-zero count in the QUBO matrix corresponds to the graph's edge count. Given that many quantum(-inspired) solvers operate through cloud services, transmitting data for dense graphs can be costly. By introducing the graph sparsification method, we aim to mitigate these communication costs. Experimental results on classical, quantum-inspired, and quantum solvers indicate that this approach substantially reduces communication overheads and yields an objective value close to the optimal solution.

<summary> <b> Philip Taranto</b>  <br> Title: Characterising & Controlling Complex Quantum Processes with Classical Memory </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Most prominently, memory can be controlled to reliably prepare states, simulate non-Markovian phenomena, enhance information processing, and control circuit architectures; such primitives are routinely used in classical computers to improve performance. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they appear ubiquitously across natural and engineered processes and can be either classical or quantum. While quantum correlations in time constitute a promising resource for future technologies, control over quantum memory might be out of reach (beyond laboratory settings) in the near future since it requires delicate experimental setups. From a practical standpoint, manipulating quantum processes with classical memory seems more manageable and promises more near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterparts, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored, and consequently so too does the usefulness of classical memory in quantum processes.<br> <br> 

We first analyse various physically motivated candidates regarding a suitable definition for classical memory that lead to remarkably distinct phenomena. In the simplest scenario—the two-time setting—quantum processes with classical memory coincide with convex mixtures of memoryless processes and are thus straightforward to analyse. However, as we demonstrate, this is no longer true in the multi-time setting: here, (classical) memory effects display a more intricate structure. Subsequently, we systematically characterise the hierarchy of multi-time memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena. Our analysis highlights that the multi-time scenario permits fundamentally different temporal correlations, even when only classical memory is considered. Since noise in quantum devices—and thus the observed memory effects—will predominantly be classical in the near future, our results provide a framework upon which reliable quantum devices can be built. The concepts explored, and results presented here should have immediate impact on various fields of quantum science, including quantum information theory, optimal control, open quantum systems, and quantum foundations, to name but a few. <br><br>

<summary> <b> Hayata Yamasaki</b>  <br> Title: Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation </summary>
<br>
Abstract: Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model that has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how to demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an experimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation.
