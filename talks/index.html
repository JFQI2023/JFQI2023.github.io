Two different quantum settings are analysed: a first, in which players are given direct access to an entangled quantum state, and a second, which we introduce here, in which they are only given classical advice obtained from quantum devices. For a given game G, these two settings give rise to different equilibria characterised by the sets of equilibrium correlations Qcorr(G) and Q(G), respectively. We show that Q(G)⊆Qcorr(G), and by exploiting the self-testing property of some correlations, that the inclusion is strict for some games G. We make use of SDP optimisation techniques to study how these quantum resources can improve social welfare, obtaining upper and lower bounds on the social welfare reachable in each setting. We investigate, for several games, how the social welfare depends on the bias of the game and improve upon a separation that was previously obtained using pseudo-telepathic solutions.<br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01687" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01687</a> </details> <details> <summary><b> Hiroo Azuma</b> <br>Title: Generation of a squeezed state using a nonlinear photonic crystal and its application to a heralded single-photon source </summary> <br> Abstract: We investigate how to generate squeezed light using a nonlinear photonic crystal. Because the photonic crystal reduces the group velocity of the incident light, if it is composed of a material with a second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility \chi^{(2)}, the interaction between the nonlinear material and the light passing through it strengthens and the quantum state of the emitted light is largely squeezed. Thus, we can generate squeezed light with a resonating cavity where the nonlinear photonic crystal is placed. Transforming this squeezed state into entangled light beams with a beam splitter, we discuss the implementation of a heralded single-photon source. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11373" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11373</a> </details> <details> <summary><b> Adriano Barile</b> <br>Title: Different Approaches Towards Formalizing and Optimizing Reversible and Quantum Circuits </summary> <br> Abstract: The talk will be focused on different approaches of scientific inquiry on some of the issues posed by the theory of the synthesis of Reversible Boolean and Quantum Circuits. The first approach is mostly mathematical, and it concerns what it means to formalize a circuit as a 2-dimensional grammar using the (arguably) cumbersome but (arguably) elegant language of category theory, with the goal of defining a "shortest normal form" for reversible/quantum circuits given a set of rewriting rules. The second approach shows what could happen if we get rid of the logical inner workings of a circuit and want to compress a quantum circuit by approximating it as an operator in a metric space - in particular, the advantages and the shortcomings of methods such as Approximate Quantum Compiling will be presented. The third and last section will be devoted to introducing some questions that I aim to answer in the period at NII: namely, the classification of ancillae in view of reaching optimal space consumption in Reversible and Quantum circuits, and the search for explicit reversibilization methods. </details> <details> <summary><b> Naphan Benchasattabuse</b> <br>Title: Lower Bounds on Number of QAOA Rounds Required for Guaranteed Approximation Ratios</summary> <br> Abstract: The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Satisfiability. While QAOA is well-studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. In this talk, I will go over our proof frameworks leveraging a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds QAOA required to guarantee (constant) approximation ratio. I will discuss results obtained from applying this proof framework on QAOA with Grover-style mixing unitaries, and show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. For the conventional transverse field mixer, our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded occurrence local cost problems and all strictly k-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with constant round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. With a small modification to our framework, our lower bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries and recovers the Grover lower bound for unstructured search.<br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15442" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15442</a> </details> <details> <summary><b> Cyril Branciard</b> <br>Title: Quantum processes and correlations with dynamical causal orders </summary> <br> Abstract: There has been a lot of interest recently in the study of quantum processes that do not just follow a fixed causal structure. E.g. processes with indefinite causal orders, as in the paradigmatic example of the "quantum switch" -- a process in which the order of 2 (or more) operations is coherently controlled by the state of a quantum system, which can be put in a quantum superposition. Another situation where the causal structure is not fixed a priori is when there is "dynamical causal order": the causal order is established on the fly, as the process evolves. In this talk I propose to explore the kind of situations with dynamical causal order that one may encounter. In particular, in which sense can the causal order be both indefinite and dynamical at the same time? </details> <details> <summary><b> Paolo Fittipaldi</b> <br>Title: A Linear Algebraic Framework for Dynamic Scheduling Over Memory-Equipped Quantum Networks </summary> <br> Abstract: Quantum Internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between arbitrary pairs of users. In this context, a scheduling policy (i.e. a set of rules that, given some amount of information about the network’s state, provides the correct set of entanglement swapping operations to perform in order to satisfy user requests) is of paramount importance to simultaneously serve multiple pairs of users over complex network topologies. In this talk, the problem of scheduling in an arbitrary quantum network is presented in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware formulation. We introduce a novel linear algebraic framework that leverages quantum memory and demonstrate how it can be employed to derive a natural class of quadratic scheduling policies for quantum networks. We then illustrate how the framework aids in describing and benchmarking several scheduling policies, with different degrees of localization and information availability. Network performance results such as the average and total user demand are discussed to evaluate the capacity regions of the proposed policies, and to provide example of application of our tools to arbitrary scheduling policies over general quantum networks with topologies of various complexity. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06009" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06009</a> </details> <details> <summary><b> Hiroshi Imai</b> <br>Title: Quantum Machine Learning and Optimization on Real Devices </summary> <br> Abstract: </details> <details> <summary><b> Aoi Hayashi</b> <br>Title: Impact of the form of weighted networks on the quantum extreme reservoir computation </summary> <br> Abstract: The recent development of quantum devices raises expectations for utilizing them for practical applications while still noisy. Driven by such expectation, quantum machine learning, considered robust to noise, is gathering much attention, and various models have been proposed. Among such models, the quantum extreme reservoir computation (QERC) [A. Sakurai, et al., Phys. Rev. Applied 17, 064044 (2022)] has already shown the capability to achieve a high accuracy rate for classification tasks with the smallest number of qubits among previous works. This model utilizes fixed Hamiltonian dynamics with a trainable classical neural network to solve tasks. As the performance of the model is dependent on the properties of the Hamiltonian dynamics, there is still room to choose and design the dynamics; however, the relation between the properties of the quantum dynamics and the model performance remains unrevealed. In this talk (based on [A. Hayashi, et al., Phys. Rev. A 108, 042609 (2023)]), we focus on the relationship between the properties of quantum dynamics and QERC performance to understand how to design quantum dynamics for this quantum machine learning model [2]. To do so, we first introduce a method to characterize unitary matrices as networks. We then apply it to several unitary matrices, including random ones, and observe how their difference is exhibited by the method. Next, we benchmark the QERC performance with those unitary matrices. We will then find the relation between the weight distribution of the networks associated with unitary matrices and the performance, especially generalization performance for image classification tasks. Lastly, we will show an example of Hamiltonian dynamics that can achieve a nearly optimal testing accuracy rate and the best generalization performance among our benchmarks. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07841" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07841</a> </details> <details> <summary><b> Michal Hajdusek</b> <br>Title: Advancing quantum architecture</summary> <br> Abstract: In this short talk, I will give a brief overview of recent results and ongoing projects at the Advancing Quantum Architecture Group (AQUA) at Keio University.

While some attention has been given to extending these concepts to higher-dimensional systems, studying them in this context appears to be more challenging than their two-level counterparts. In particular, violating Bell inequalities based on Clifford operations with stabilizer states in qudit systems is futile as they are efficiently simulatable. Beyond Clifford operations, Bell inequalities have been proposed whose classical bound or the extent of quantum violation have been difficult to quantify. Furthermore, they resort to operations intrinsic to higher or lower dimensional systems than those of interest. We propose a family of Bell inequalities based on a generalization of the qubit $\pi/8$ gate and the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under their adjoint action. These operators are fully characterized within the finite field of their prime dimension. The classical bound is simple to compute and a specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states. We exemplify these Bell inequalities on qudit graph states and formalize a mapping that implements local complementation of the underlying weighted graphs. Lastly, we present a simple family of Bell inequalities violated by the singlet state relying on operations innate to higher dimensional systems than the examined one. </details> <details> <summary> <b>Mio Murao</b> <br> Title: </summary> <br> </details> <details> <summary> <b>Ion Nechita</b> <br> Title: Monogamy of highly symmetric states </summary> <br> Abstract: We study the question of how highly entangled two particles can be when also entangled in a similar way with other particles on the complete graph Kn for the case of Werner, isotropic and Brauer states.

In recent years, the possibility of relaxing this constraint to obtain causally in- definite computations has received significant attention. The quantum switch, for example, uses a quantum system to coherently control the order of operations. Several ad hoc computational and information-theoretical advantages have been demonstrated, raising questions as to whether advantages can be obtained in a more unified complexity theoretic framework. In this paper, we approach this problem by studying the query complexity of Boolean functions under general higher order quantum computations. To this end, we generalise the framework of query complexity from quantum circuits to quantum supermaps to compare different models on an equal footing. We show that the recently introduced class of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order cannot lead to any reduction in query complexity, and that any potential advantage arising from causally indefinite supermaps can be bounded by the polynomial method, as is the case with quantum cir- cuits. Nevertheless, we find some functions for which the minimum error with which they can be computed using two queries is strictly lower when exploiting causally indefinite supermaps. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10285" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10285</a> </details> <details> <summary> <b>Bernard Ousmane Sane</b> <br> Title: Fight or Flight: Cosmic Ray-Induced Phonons and the Quantum Surface Code </summary> <br> Abstract: Recent work has identified cosmic ray events as an error source limiting the lifetime of quantum data. These errors are correlated and affect a large number of qubits, leading to the loss of data across a quantum chip. Previous works attempting to address the problem in hardware or by building distributed systems still have limitations. We approach the problem from a different perspective, developing a new hybrid hardware-software-based strategy based on the 2-D surface code, assuming the parallel development of a hardware strategy that limits the phonon propagation radius. We propose to flee the area: move the logical qubits far enough away from the strike’s epicenter to maintain our logical information. Specifically, we: (1) propose a mapping for moving logical qubits; (2) establish goals for the hardware parameters needed to use our approach; and (3) evaluate the possible choice of the code distance. Our analysis considers two possible cosmic ray events: those far from both “holes” in the surface code and those near or overlapping a hole. We show that the probability that the logical qubit will be destroyed can be reduced from 100% to the range 4% to 15% depending on the time required to move the logical qubit. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16533" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16533</a> </details> <details> <summary> <b>Akihito Soeda</b> <br> Title: Inter-node quantum operations and assessment of devices for such operations </summary> <br> Abstract: Global operations between network nodes are crucial to achieve any benefit of quantum computation.

Quantum(-inspired) algorithms are recognized for their potential efficiency in handling quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Given that maxcut is an NP-hard problem and can be readily expressed using QUBO, it stands out as an exemplary case to demonstrate the effectiveness of quantum(-inspired) QUBO approaches. Here, the non-zero count in the QUBO matrix corresponds to the graph's edge count. Given that many quantum(-inspired) solvers operate through cloud services, transmitting data for dense graphs can be costly. By introducing the graph sparsification method, we aim to mitigate these communication costs. Experimental results on classical, quantum-inspired, and quantum solvers indicate that this approach substantially reduces communication overheads and yields an objective value close to the optimal solution. </details> <details> <summary> <b> Philip Taranto</b> <br> Title: Characterising &amp; Controlling Complex Quantum Processes with Classical Memory </summary> <br> Abstract: Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Most prominently, memory can be controlled to reliably prepare states, simulate non-Markovian phenomena, enhance information processing, and control circuit architectures; such primitives are routinely used in classical computers to improve performance. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they appear ubiquitously across natural and engineered processes and can be either classical or quantum. While quantum correlations in time constitute a promising resource for future technologies, control over quantum memory might be out of reach (beyond laboratory settings) in the near future since it requires delicate experimental setups. From a practical standpoint, manipulating quantum processes with classical memory seems more manageable and promises more near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterparts, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored, and consequently so too does the usefulness of classical memory in quantum processes.<br> <br> We first analyse various physically motivated candidates regarding a suitable definition for classical memory that lead to remarkably distinct phenomena. In the simplest scenario—the two-time setting—quantum processes with classical memory coincide with convex mixtures of memoryless processes and are thus straightforward to analyse. However, as we demonstrate, this is no longer true in the multi-time setting: here, (classical) memory effects display a more intricate structure. Subsequently, we systematically characterise the hierarchy of multi-time memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena. Our analysis highlights that the multi-time scenario permits fundamentally different temporal correlations, even when only classical memory is considered. Since noise in quantum devices—and thus the observed memory effects—will predominantly be classical in the near future, our results provide a framework upon which reliable quantum devices can be built. The concepts explored, and results presented here should have immediate impact on various fields of quantum science, including quantum information theory, optimal control, open quantum systems, and quantum foundations, to name but a few. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11905" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11905</a> </details> <details> <summary> <b> Yu Tanaka</b> <br> Title: </summary> <br> Abstract:&lt;/a&gt; </details> <details> <summary> <b> Hayata Yamasaki</b> <br> Title: Energy-Consumption Advantage of Quantum Computation </summary> <br> Abstract: Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of various computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model that has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound for the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop techniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With these general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving a specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how to demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an experimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of quantum computation. <br><br> arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11212" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11212</a> </details> <details> <summary> <b> Bo Yang</b> <br> Title: Quantum State Purification with Symmetry Subgroup Projectors </summary> <br> Abstract: The future quantum ecosystem will be likely to adopt the client-server model, where the client with limited quantum ability delegates its computation to the server with universal quantum computational ability. Under this scenario, the client may prefer to keep the computation blind against the server and verify the correctness of the outcome. For the case where a client has the ability to prepare and send single-qubit to the server, this is answered by [Fitzsimons and Kashefi, 2012], achieving the blind verification of both quantum and classical inputs and outputs, while requiring fault-tolerance on the server side. Recently, to make [Fitzsimons and Kashefi, 2012] robust to harmless noise without fault-tolerance, [Leichtle, Music, Kashefi, and Ollivier, 2021] provides a robust blind verification for classical inputs and outputs by using the classical majority vote. However, the robust verification of quantum outputs without fault-tolerance in this prepare-and-send model is still an open question. To approach this, we first try to design a quantum state purification gadget that is affordable without fault-tolerance. Particularly, in this work, we provide a gadget that distils multiple noisy quantum states into one purified quantum state by projecting them into their symmetry subspace created by the cyclic group. We also analyse the optimal conditions in the number of state inputs and evaluate the performance through the numerical simulation.
